# Functional-Light JS, You Don't Know JS and You Don't Know JS Yet ePub

Functional Light JS, You Don't Know JS and You Don't Know JS Yet ePub generator.

- Original book series by Kyle Simpson:
  [You Don't Know JS Yet 2nd Edition](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed) (in progress), [You Don't Know JS 1st Edition](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md) and [Functional-Light JS](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS).

## Generate the ePub

Run with Docker:

```sh
# force update to the latest image
docker pull gongzhang/ydkjs-epub

# generate epub into output folder
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/output:/root/output gongzhang/ydkjs-epub
```

Then the generated epub files are in `output` folder:

Note that the first two books (_Get Started_ and _Scope & Closures_) are from the latest 2nd edition, and the rest are from the 1st edition.

## Customization

First, recursively clone this repo to your machine:

```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:gongzhang/you-dont-know-js-epub.git
```

Then you can:

- Modify `epub.css` to customize the style.
- Read `gen.sh` to understand how the generator works.
- Fetch the latest book content using git submodule command under `1st-edition` and `2nd-edition` directory.

Finally, rebuild the Docker image and generate your own version epubs:

```sh
docker build -t ydkjs-epub .
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/output:/root/output ydkjs-epub
```

additional Note (to get latest content)

```sh
# initial your git submodule in your local repo
git submodule init

# Change to the submodule directory
# replace 'submodule_dir' with '1st-edition' & '2nd-edition' respectively
cd submodule_dir

# Checkout desired branch
# replace 'master' with updated branch respectively
# At 2020/07/05, it is '1st-ed' and '2nd-ed' respectively

git checkout master

# Update
git pull

# Get back to your project root
cd ..
```

## Known Issues & TODOs

- Support syntax highlighing (The latest pandoc _does_ support syntax highlight, but the genrated ePub cannot be correctly rendered by iBooks app.)
